# Exchange Rate Calculator

## Introduction

The tiny program was designed when I started learning react. When the program starts running, it will automatically call the interface of the `exchange rate api` and the `full/short name of currency api`. 

The program shows the dollar-euro exchange rate by default. When you choose other currency by the `select tag`, the real-time exchange rate will change immediately. 

You can also input amount in the `input tag` , the other `input tag` will be calculate in real time. Moreover, once you click on the `exchange button`, the exchange rate and the value you enter will also be exchanged.
